# Future: Codebase Analysis for Context Engineering

## Goal
Enable lolek-mcp to automatically analyze each codebase where it's deployed and generate application-specific operational rules.

## Key Features to Implement

### 1. Codebase Scanner
- Analyze project structure and file patterns
- Detect frameworks, libraries, and toolchains
- Identify coding conventions and patterns
- Map dependency relationships

### 2. Rule Generation Engine
- Convert analysis into strict operational guidelines
- Generate project-specific workflows
- Create custom tool usage patterns
- Define performance optimization strategies

### 3. Context Synthesis
- Merge codebase analysis with existing guides from `/documents` and `/examples`
- Prioritize project-specific patterns over generic ones
- Generate CLAUDE.md-style instructions tailored to each project
- Update rules based on project evolution

### 4. Integration Points
- Hook into MCP server initialization
- Provide real-time rule updates
- Cache analysis results for performance
- Support incremental updates as codebase changes

## Implementation Considerations
- Should run efficiently without blocking MCP server operations
- Must handle large codebases gracefully
- Need versioning for generated rules
- Consider privacy/security for sensitive codebases
