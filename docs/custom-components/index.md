### Breadcrumb Navigation System
- Breadcrumb Component Design - Navigation breadcrumb component displaying current page hierarchy with centralized configuration system
- Breadcrumb Configuration - Centralized configuration system for defining breadcrumb structures and hierarchies with route mapping
- Page-Level Breadcrumb Setup - Standard pattern for implementing breadcrumb updates in page components using useEffect
- Dynamic Breadcrumb Updates - Advanced pattern for updating breadcrumbs with dynamic data such as user names, IDs, or contextual information
- BreadcrumbContext Implementation - React Context implementation for managing breadcrumb state across the application

### Breadcrumb Implementation Requirements

- List Pages Breadcrumb Pattern - Standard breadcrumb implementation for base module list pages showing only module name
- Create Pages Breadcrumb Pattern - Breadcrumb implementation for create/new pages with parent module link and current create action
- Edit Pages Breadcrumb Pattern - Breadcrumb implementation for edit/detail pages with parent module link and actual item name
- Dashboard Pages Breadcrumb Pattern - Breadcrumb implementation for dashboard pages showing only "Dashboard" without additional hierarchy
- Implementation Tasks Checklist - Complete checklist of tasks required to implement breadcrumb navigation and remove existing "back to" buttons
- Breadcrumb Data Loading Patterns - Patterns for handling breadcrumb updates during asynchronous data loading with loading states and error handling
- Validation Criteria and Testing - Complete validation criteria and testing procedures to ensure breadcrumb implementation meets requirements
- Common Breadcrumb Implementation Errors - Documentation of frequently encountered errors during breadcrumb implementation and their solutions

## 2. Layout Components  

### Component Structure Patterns
- Sidebar Toggle Implementation - Button component within MainHeader controlling sidebar open/close state with visual state changes
- Header Layout Patterns - CSS and styling patterns for MainHeader component ensuring consistent layout across screen sizes
- Breadcrumb Styling - CSS styles for breadcrumb component providing clear visual hierarchy and responsive behavior within MainHeader
- Main Layout Pattern - Standard layout structure combining MainHeader with sidebar and content areas for consistent page implementation

## 3. Implementation Patterns

### Integration Workflows
- Component Integration Workflow - Step-by-step guide for integrating MainHeader and breadcrumb components into new pages within main folder structure

### State Management
- Context Implementation - React Context patterns for centralized state management across components
- Component Communication - Patterns for state sharing between header, sidebar, and breadcrumb components
- Lifecycle Management - useEffect patterns for component mounting, updating, and cleanup

## 4. Common Problems and Solutions

### Component Issues
- Common Problems and Solutions - Documentation of frequently encountered issues when implementing MainHeader and breadcrumb system with solutions

### Navigation Problems  
- Breadcrumb update timing and route change handling
- Sidebar state synchronization with toggle button
- Header z-index conflicts with modals and dropdowns
- Mobile responsiveness issues with header content overlap

### Implementation Errors
- Current page href property errors
- Missing cleanup functions causing breadcrumb persistence
- Setting breadcrumbs before data loads
- Forgetting to remove "back to" buttons
- Incorrect dependency arrays in useEffect

## 5. Development Guidelines

### Component Standards
- Authentication integration patterns with AppContextProvider
- Mobile-friendly design requirements following UI development guidelines  
- Responsive behavior with proper breakpoint handling and touch targets
- Integration with shadcn/ui component library and lucide-react icons

### Testing Requirements
- Cross-device functionality verification
- Touch interaction testing on mobile devices
- Integration testing with sidebar mobile behavior
- Accessibility standards validation for mobile users

### Performance Considerations
- Memory leak prevention with proper cleanup functions
- Avoiding unnecessary re-renders with proper dependency management
- Fast navigation with breadcrumb link optimization
- Smooth transitions between breadcrumb states
