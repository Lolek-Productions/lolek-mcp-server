### User Permission Protocol

**When you need to deviate from MCP server guidance, use this EXACT format:**
```
üö® MCP DEVIATION REQUEST:
I need to [specific action] which is outside the MCP server parameters.
Reason: [why it's necessary]
Current MCP guidance: [what the MCP server says about this]
May I proceed with this deviation?
```

**DO NOT PROCEED WITHOUT A CLEAR "YES" FROM THE USER**

## STRICT OPERATIONAL RULES

### 1. Structural Decision Framework
- ALWAYS consult DATABASE.md before making any structural decisions
- NEVER create database tables, models, or schemas without referencing current structure
- ALWAYS align component architecture with database relationships
- NEVER implement features that conflict with established data patterns

**DATABASE.md REQUIREMENTS:**
- **DATABASE.md IS EXPLICITLY REQUIRED AND ALLOWED** by this CLAUDE.md document
- Reading DATABASE.md is MANDATORY, not a deviation from MCP server rules
- Following DATABASE.md structure is REQUIRED by this MCP server
- Database constraints from DATABASE.md are PART OF the MCP server guidance
- You do NOT need permission to consult DATABASE.md - it is expressly required

**IF DATABASE.md IS MISSING OR DEFICIENT:**
- IMMEDIATELY alert the user that DATABASE.md is required but missing/incomplete
- Offer to help generate or update DATABASE.md using available database schema
- Explain that proper development cannot proceed without complete DATABASE.md
- Provide specific steps to create or fix the DATABASE.md file
- Do NOT proceed with development until DATABASE.md is complete and accurate

### 2. File Management Protocol
- ALWAYS edit existing files instead of creating new ones
- NEVER create documentation files unless explicitly requested
- ALWAYS check if similar functionality exists before implementing
- NEVER duplicate code across files
- ALWAYS verify file changes align with DATABASE.md structure

### 3. Component Development
- ALWAYS use `get-development-guide-index` to see available components before creating new ones
- ALWAYS use `get-development-guide-section` to get specific component implementations
- ALWAYS follow established naming conventions that match database entities
- NEVER create components without proper TypeScript types derived from database schema
- ALWAYS use existing utility functions and hooks from development guide
- NEVER build UI components that don't align with data model

### 4. State Management
- ALWAYS use existing state management patterns from development guide that mirror database structure

## Architecture Overview

### Application Structure
This is a Next.js 15 application with TypeScript, featuring:
- **App Router** with route groups for organization
- **Supabase** for authentication and database
- **Tailwind CSS** with shadcn/ui components
- **Server Actions** for data mutations
- **Middleware** for authentication protection

### Key Directories
- `src/app/` - Next.js App Router pages and layouts
  - `(main)/` - Authenticated user pages
  - `(public)/` - Public pages (landing, login, etc.)
  - `(print)/` - Print-optimized pages
- `src/components/` - Reusable UI components
- `src/lib/` - Utility functions and configurations
- `src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks
- `src/types/` - TypeScript type definitions

### Authentication Flow
1. User visits protected route
2. Middleware checks for valid session
3. If no session, redirect to `/login`
4. After login, redirect to intended page
5. Session managed by Supabase Auth

## Development Patterns

### Component Creation
**ALWAYS check `list-examples` and `get-agent-rules` before creating components**

When creating new components:
1. **First**: Use `list-examples` to find existing component patterns
2. **Then**: Use `get-agent-rules` to understand component usage rules
3. Use TypeScript with proper prop typing
4. Follow existing naming conventions (PascalCase for components)
5. Include proper imports and exports
6. Add error boundaries for complex components
7. Use shadcn/ui components when available (but check agent rules first)

### Database Operations
**ALWAYS check `get-agent-rules` for database constraints before making changes**

- Use Supabase client for browser operations
- Use Supabase server client for server-side operations
- Implement Row Level Security (RLS) policies (preferred)
- Use TypeScript for database types
- Handle errors gracefully with try/catch
- **NEVER create Supabase migrations without checking agent rules first**

### API Routes and Server Actions
**ALWAYS use `list-examples` to find existing patterns before creating new routes**

- Prefer Server Actions over API routes for mutations
- Use proper TypeScript typing for all functions
- Implement proper error handling
- Validate inputs using Zod or similar
- Return consistent response formats

### Styling Guidelines
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Follow mobile-first responsive design
- Use shadcn/ui components for consistency
- Maintain consistent spacing and typography
- Use CSS variables for theming

## Code Quality Standards

### TypeScript Usage
- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Avoid `any` types - use proper typing
- Create interfaces for complex objects
- Use generic types where appropriate
- Document complex type definitions

### Error Handling
- Always handle potential errors
- Use try/catch for async operations
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors for debugging
- Show user-friendly error states

### Testing Requirements
- Write unit tests for utility functions
- Create integration tests for critical flows
- Test components with React Testing Library
- Mock external dependencies
- Maintain test coverage above 80%

## Deployment Configuration

### Environment Variables
Required environment variables:
```bash
# Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### Build Process
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run linting: `npm run lint`
3. Run tests: `npm test`
4. Build application: `npm run build`
5. Start production server: `npm start`

### Vercel Deployment
- Use Node.js 18+ runtime
- Configure environment variables in Vercel dashboard
- Enable edge functions for better performance
- Set up automatic deployments from main branch

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- Always validate user sessions
- Use Row Level Security (RLS) in Supabase
- Implement proper permission checks
- Never expose sensitive data to client
- Use secure session management

### Data Protection
- Sanitize user inputs
- Use parameterized queries
- Implement rate limiting
- Validate all API inputs
- Use HTTPS in production

## Performance Optimization

### Code Splitting
- Use dynamic imports for large components
- Implement route-based code splitting
- Lazy load non-critical resources
- Use React.lazy() for component loading

### Database Optimization
- Use proper indexes
- Implement efficient queries
- Use connection pooling
- Cache frequent queries
- Monitor query performance

### Asset Optimization
- Optimize images with Next.js Image component
- Use proper image formats (WebP, AVIF)
- Implement lazy loading
- Minify CSS and JavaScript
- Use CDN for static assets

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Build failures**: Check TypeScript errors and ESLint warnings
- **Database connection**: Verify environment variables and network access
- **Authentication issues**: Check Supabase configuration and RLS policies
- **Styling problems**: Ensure Tailwind classes are properly imported

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check environment variables
npm run env:check

# Verify database connection
npm run db:test

# Run type checking
npm run type-check

# Check bundle size
npm run analyze
```

### Logging
- Use structured logging with appropriate levels
- Log errors with full stack traces
- Include request context in logs
- Monitor logs in production
- Set up error tracking (e.g., Sentry)
