# Example Next.js MCP Server

**Uses `@vercel/mcp-adapter`**


## Usage

This sample app uses the [Vercel MCP Adapter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vercel/mcp-adapter) that allows you to drop in an MCP server on a group of routes in any Next.js project.

Update `app/[transport]/route.ts` with your tools, prompts, and resources following the [MCP TypeScript SDK documentation](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#server).

## Notes for running on Vercel

- To use the SSE transport, requires a Redis attached to the project under `process.env.REDIS_URL`
- Make sure you have [Fluid compute](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/fluid-compute) enabled for efficient execution
//From the website: As of April 23, 2025, fluid compute is enabled by default for new projects.
- After enabling Fluid compute, open `app/route.ts` and adjust `maxDuration` to 800 if you using a Vercel Pro or Enterprise account
- [Deploy the Next.js MCP template](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/model-context-protocol-mcp-with-next-js)

## Sample Client
